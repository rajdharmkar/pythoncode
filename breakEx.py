#In this program, we iterate through the "string" sequence. We check if the letter is "i",
#upon which we break from the loop. Hence, we see in our output that all the letters up
#till "i" gets printed. After that, the loop terminates. 

#The break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop. 

#If break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), break will terminate the innermost loop. 

#Syntax of break 

#break
#In Python, break and continue statements can alter the flow of a normal loop. 

#Loops iterate over a block of code until test expression is false, but sometimes we wish to terminate the current iteration or even the whole loop without checking test expression.
