for val in "string":
    if val == "i":
        continue
    print(val),

print("The end")
#The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for
#the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the
#next iteration. 

#Syntax of Continue 

#continue 
#We continue with the loop, if the string is "i", not executing the rest of
#the block. Hence, we see in our output that all the letters except "i" gets
#printed.
